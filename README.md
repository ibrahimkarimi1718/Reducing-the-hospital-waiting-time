# Reducing-the-hospital-waiting-time
The objective of the project was improving patient satisfaction by reduction in patient wait times and optimizing resource utilization.
The inefficient scheduling of appointments at a Hospital in California, USA, led to excessive patient wait times, surpassing the industry benchmark, unlike competitors who maintain an average wait time of 30 minutes. This gap resulted in:

Patient dissatisfaction: Extended wait times can frustrate patients, adversely affecting their experience and loyalty, potentially leading them to seek care elsewhere.
Underutilized resources: Unfilled slots, idle staff, and inefficient use of examination rooms represent wasted resources and lost revenue opportunities.
Financial losses: Missed revenue from unfilled appointments and additional costs associated with rescheduling further erode the financial performance.
The objective of the project was:

Reduction in patient wait times closer to the industry benchmark of 30 minutes
Streamlined appointment booking and reduced wait times to enhance patient experience and loyalty
Optimization of staff and examination rooms efficiently to maximize resources and minimize waste
Increment in revenue by Reduces missed appointments and improves scheduling processes
Increase patient satisfaction by 15%
